This directory contains a LaTeX-class master.cls to be used for a master
or a bachelor thesis in the study programs Bioinformatics and Computing
in Science. The class is documented in master.pdf.
A template for a thesis with examples showing how to
use different predefined Latex-environments is given in template.tex.

type

make

to run latexmk -pdf generating template.pdf.

Recommendations:

- use git to keep track of the different versions of the files making up the
  master thesis

- put the files containing figures which come in other formats but not Latex
  into the subdirectory figures.

- put the files containing tables which come in other formats but not Latex
  into the subdirectory tables.

- all material (figures and tables) in Latex-format should directly go into
  template.tex This is much easier to handle and modify than distributing the
  sources over several files.

- use your own macros to improve consistency and modifiability of the
  used notation.

- use a spell checker and correct spelling mistakes before you read the
  document or give it to others for reading.
