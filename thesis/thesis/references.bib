  abstract = {DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

  abstract = {In similarity-driven virtual screening, molecular fingerprints are widely used to assess the similarity of all compounds contained in a chemical library to a query compound of interest. This similarity analysis is traditionally done for each member of the library individually. When encoding chemical spaces that surpass billions of compounds in size, it becomes impractical to enumerate all their products, let alone assess their similarity, deeming this approach impossible without investing a substantial amount of resources. In this work, we present a novel search algorithm named SpaceLight for topological fingerprint similarity searching in large, practically non-enumerable combinatorial fragment spaces. In contrast to existing methods, SpaceLight is able to utilize the combinatorial character of these chemical spaces for efficiency while maintaining a high correlation of the description of molecular similarity to well-known molecular fingerprints like ECFP. The resulting software is able to search prominent spaces like EnamineREAL with more than 10 billion compounds in seconds on a standard desktop computer.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking is a standard technique in structure-based drug design (SBDD). It aims to predict the 3D structure of a small molecule in the binding site of a receptor (often a protein). Despite being a common technique, it often necessitates multiple tools and involves manual steps. Here, we present the JAMDA preprocessing and docking workflow that is easy to use and allows fully automated docking. We evaluate the JAMDA docking workflow on binding sites extracted from the complete PDB and derive key factors determining JAMDA’s docking performance. With that, we try to remove most of the bias due to manual intervention and provide a realistic estimate of the redocking performance of our JAMDA preprocessing and docking workflow for any PDB structure. On this large PDBScan22 data set, our JAMDA workflow finds a pose with an RMSD of at most 2 Å to the crystal ligand on the top rank for 30.1\% of the structures. When applying objective structure quality filters to the PDBScan22 data set, the success rate increases to 61.8\%. Given the prepared structures from the JAMDA preprocessing pipeline, both JAMDA and the widely used AutoDock Vina perform comparably on this filtered data set (the PDBScan22-HQ data set).},

  abstract = {The growing size of make-on-demand chemical libraries is posing new challenges to cheminformatics. These ultra-large chemical libraries became too large for exhaustive enumeration. Using a combinatorial approach instead, the resource requirement scales approximately with the number of synthons instead of the number of molecules. This gives access to billions or trillions of compounds as so-called chemical spaces with moderate hardware and in a reasonable time frame. While extremely performant ligand-based 2D methods exist in this context, 3D methods still largely rely on exhaustive enumeration and therefore fail to apply. Here, we present SpaceGrow: a novel shape-based 3D approach for ligand-based virtual screening of billions of compounds within hours on a single CPU. Compared to a conventional superposition tool, SpaceGrow shows comparable pose reproduction capacity based on RMSD and superior ranking performance while being orders of magnitude faster. Result assessment of two differently sized subsets of the eXplore space reveals a higher probability of finding superior results in larger spaces highlighting the potential of searching in ultra-large spaces. Furthermore, the application of SpaceGrow in a drug discovery workflow was investigated in four examples involving G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with the aim to identify compounds with similar binding capabilities and molecular novelty.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

These technologies enable to search for new chemical matter in a much broader and deeper manner with less effort and fewer financial resources. These transformational developments require new cheminformatics approaches to make huge chemical spaces searchable and analyzable with low resources, and with as little energy consumption as possible.

In this paper, we present SpaceProp2, an evolution of the SpaceProp algorithm, which enables the calculation of exact property distributions for chemical fragment spaces without enumerating them. We extend the original algorithm by the capabilities to compute distributions for the TPSA, the number of rotatable bonds, and the occurrence of user-defined molecular structures in the form of SMARTS patterns. Furthermore, SpaceProp2 produces example molecules for every property bin, enabling a detailed interpretation of the distributions. We demonstrate SpaceProp2 on six established make-on-demand chemical fragment spaces as well as BICLAIM, the in-house fragment space of Boehringer Ingelheim. The possibility to search multiple SMARTS patterns simultaneously as well as the produced example molecules offers previously impossible insights into the composition of these vast combinatorial molecule collections, making it an ideal tool for the analysis and design of chemical fragment spaces.},

Each node in the tree is labeled with a set of features representing chemical properties of the part of the molecule corresponding to the node. The comparison of feature trees is based on matching subtrees of two feature trees onto each other. Two algorithms for tackling the matching problem are described throughout this paper. On a dataset of about 1000 molecules, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify molecules belonging to the same class of inhibitors. With a second dataset of 58 molecules with known binding modes taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, we show that the matchings produced by our algorithms are compatible with the relative orientation of the molecules in the active site in 61\% of the test cases.

  abstract = {Commercial make-on-demand compound spaces have become increasingly popular within the past few years. Since these libraries are too large for enumeration, they are usually accessed using combinatorial fragment space technologies like FTrees-FS and SpaceLight. Although both search types are of high practical impact, they lack the ability to search for precise structural features on the atomic level. To address this important use case, we developed SpaceMACS enabling efficient and precise maximum common induced substructure (MCIS) similarity and substructure searches within chemical fragment spaces. SpaceMACS enumerates a user-defined number of compounds in a multistep procedure. First, substructures of the query are extracted and matched to all fragments of the space. Then partial results are combined to actual compounds of the space. In this way, SpaceMACS identifies common substructures even if they cross fragment borders. We applied SpaceMACS on three commercial fragment spaces searching for the 150\,000 most similar analogs to a glucosyltransferase binder from literature. We were able to find almost all building blocks used for the synthesis of the 90 listed analogs and a plethora of additional results. SpaceMACS is the missing link to enable rational drug discovery on make-on-demand combinatorial catalogs. No matter whether initial compound suggestions come from a de novo design, an AI-based compound generation, or a medicinal chemist’s drawing board, the method gives access to the structurally closest chemically available analogs in seconds to at most minutes.},

  abstract = {Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure1. Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold2, at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},
